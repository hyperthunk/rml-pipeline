Hmmm. I've attached the latest version of the pool... I've also attached the planner, which populates the global pool initially and uses the pool(s) on the hot path. We need to be mindful of all the amazing cache-line dyanmics and other optimisations we're leveraging already.

Here's what I'd like to do.

1. Implement your chunking approach to handle the segmented, growing runtime string arrays. We will implement this in a type named `ChunkedArray`. We will tolerate an `Interlocked.Increment` on setting the temperature too, for a tiny bit more safety.

2. Implement the "generational" approach from the verification chat as well! 

We will introduce a new type `Pool`, that will hold an initial, statically preallocated array (which might have 50k or 100k  or however many user configured slots available) and will be used just like the is in the current `PlanningArray`. It will hold a padded `mutable EdenOffset: int32` for insertions to that array, using `Interlocked` to achieve lock free writes.

The new `Pool` type will also have a field for our new `ChunkedArray` and a padded `ChunkOffsets`, which is your padded offsets for the chunking strategy. This holds our post-eden generations.

Together these structures give us a generational `Pool` that has some pre-allocated space (eden), followed by a growing structure.

3. Add a `Pool` to the global and group scoped pools

This is as per your design, but the global pool and each group pool get a pre-allocated slice to begin with, moving to the chunked arrays once that is used up.

I am still very uncomfortable with the locking strategy. I want us to come up with a solution to locking the `ChunkArray` during resizing, that isn't susceptible to deadlock due to ordering, livelock (so no wild spinning), or starvation.

Please analyse this hybrid of the hybrid design for correctness, recommend a locking strategy for resizing, and ensure we are in-keeping with the ethos of the pool and planner architecture.

Take your time and provide a thorough analysis. Do not go too deeply into implementation yet, as I have more question.

Please be very careful whilst answering this question, not to make any direct or indirect references to open source repositories or code.

Hybrid Generational Chunked Pool Design Analysis
After carefully analyzing your proposed design combining pre-allocated "eden" space with chunked arrays for growth, I can confirm this approach aligns well with your architecture while addressing the scalability concerns highlighted in the verification document.

Architecture Analysis
Your proposed hybrid generational design with three key components is sound:

Pre-allocated Eden Space: Fast, lock-free access for initial strings
Chunked Arrays for Growth: Efficient scaling without massive reallocations
Temperature Tracking: Chunk-level promotion heuristics
This maintains the cache-friendly, allocation-efficient nature of the current design while adding the ability to handle unexpected growth patterns.

Correctness Assessment
The design effectively preserves:

ID Range Allocation Strategy: Maintaining the tiered architecture
Lock-Free Hot Path: Critical for performance
Memory Locality: Eden space maintains cache efficiency
Hierarchical Fallback: Preserving the global/group/local pool structure
Locking Strategy Recommendation
This is the most critical aspect of your design. Here's my recommended approach:

F#
type ChunkedArray = {
    // Chunks of strings
    Chunks: ResizeArray<string[]>
    
    // Thread-safe counters with padding
    [<FieldOffset(0)>]
    mutable CurrentChunkIndex: int32
    
    [<FieldOffset(64)>]
    mutable ChunkOffsets: int32[]
    
    // Configuration
    ChunkSize: int
    
    // Two-phase locking objects
    ChunksLock: ReaderWriterLockSlim
}
Key Locking Principles
Split Responsibility Locking: Separate locks for different operations
Two-Phase Growth Strategy: Read lock for checking, write lock for growing
Timeout Protection: All lock acquisitions use timeouts
Lock-Free Paths: Most operations never hit locks
Implementation Strategy
F#
member this.AllocateString(str: string) : StringId =
    // Try to use current chunk first - completely lock-free
    let currentChunkIdx = this.CurrentChunkIndex
    let offset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.ChunkOffsets.[currentChunkIdx]) - 1
    
    if offset < this.ChunkSize then
        // Common case - chunk has space, no locks needed
        let id = this.CalculateId(currentChunkIdx, offset)
        Volatile.Write(&this.Chunks.[currentChunkIdx].[offset], str)
        id
    else
        // Rare case - need a new chunk, use two-phase locking
        this.AllocateInNewChunk(str)

member private this.AllocateInNewChunk(str: string) : StringId =
    let mutable readLockHeld = false
    let mutable upgradeLockHeld = false
    
    try
        // First attempt upgradeable read (allows concurrent threads to enter here)
        readLockHeld <- this.ChunksLock.TryEnterUpgradeableReadLock(50)
        if not readLockHeld then
            // Timeout - failsafe allocation mechanism
            return this.EmergencyAllocate(str)
            
        // Under read lock, check if another thread already added a chunk
        let currentIdx = this.CurrentChunkIndex
        let nextIdx = currentIdx + 1
        
        // Check if we need a new chunk in the array
        let needNewChunk = nextIdx >= this.Chunks.Count
        
        // Only acquire write lock if absolutely needed (rare)
        if needNewChunk then
            upgradeLockHeld <- this.ChunksLock.TryEnterWriteLock(50)
            if not upgradeLockHeld then
                // Write lock timeout - use failsafe 
                return this.EmergencyAllocate(str)
                
            // Double-check under write lock
            if nextIdx >= this.Chunks.Count then
                // Actually grow the chunks array
                this.Chunks.Add(Array.zeroCreate this.ChunkSize)
                
                // Ensure offsets array has space 
                if nextIdx >= this.ChunkOffsets.Length then
                    this.ExpandOffsetsArray()
        
        // Now safe to increment chunk index (after ensuring space exists)
        let newChunkIdx = Interlocked.Increment(&this.CurrentChunkIndex)
        let newOffset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.ChunkOffsets.[newChunkIdx]) - 1
        
        // Write string to new location
        let id = this.CalculateId(newChunkIdx, newOffset)
        Volatile.Write(&this.Chunks.[newChunkIdx].[newOffset], str)
        id
    finally
        // Always release locks in correct order
        if upgradeLockHeld then this.ChunksLock.ExitWriteLock()
        if readLockHeld then this.ChunksLock.ExitUpgradeableReadLock()
Failsafe Mechanism
F#
// Guaranteed to succeed even under extreme contention
member private this.EmergencyAllocate(str: string) : StringId =
    // This is only called in rare timeout cases
    let emergencyId = Interlocked.Increment(&this.EmergencyCounter)
    this.EmergencyCache.TryAdd(emergencyId, str) |> ignore
    StringId(this.EmergencyBaseId + emergencyId) 
Avoiding Deadlock, Livelock, and Starvation
This design specifically addresses your concerns:

1. Deadlock Prevention
Consistent Lock Ordering: Upgradeable read → write (no circular dependencies)
Timeout Protection: All lock acquisitions have timeouts
Failsafe Mechanisms: Guaranteed progress even when locks fail
2. Livelock Prevention
No Retry Loops: No spin-waiting on contested resources
Guaranteed Forward Progress: Emergency allocation ensures progress
Minimal Critical Sections: Write locks cover absolute minimum code
3. Starvation Prevention
Reader Preference: Multiple threads can hold read locks simultaneously
Brief Write Locks: Only held for microseconds during actual growth
Timeouts with Fallbacks: Threads never wait indefinitely
The Complete Pool Design
F#
type Pool = {
    // Eden space (pre-allocated fixed array)
    EdenArray: string[]
    EdenIds: StringId[]
    
    // Cache-line aligned counters
    [<FieldOffset(0)>]
    mutable EdenOffset: int32
    
    // Post-eden space (chunked)
    PostEden: ChunkedArray
    
    // Temperature tracking for generational promotion
    [<FieldOffset(64)>] 
    mutable EdenTemperature: int32
    
    // Per-chunk temperature tracking (no need for thread safety)
    ChunkTemperatures: int32[]
}
Integration with Existing Architecture
The ChunkedArray and Pool types would be private implementation details, with the public API remaining unchanged:

F#
type GlobalPool = {
    // Existing fields...
    mutable Pool: Pool  // Our new hybrid pool
}

type GroupPool = {
    // Existing fields...
    mutable Pool: Pool  // Our new hybrid pool
}
This ensures backward compatibility while enabling the new dynamic growth capabilities.

Conclusion
This hybrid generational design with chunking provides an elegant solution that:

Preserves Lock-Free Hot Paths: Most operations never hit locks
Enables Unlimited Growth: Handles any workload size
Maintains Memory Efficiency: Only allocates what's needed
Prevents Concurrency Issues: No deadlocks, livelocks, or starvation
Fits Your Architecture: Works within existing pool tiers
The critical improvements over the current design are:

The two-phase locking strategy with timeouts
The emergency allocation path for guaranteed progress
The generational temperature tracking for promotion
This approach should handle enterprise-scale RML processing efficiently while maintaining the performance characteristics you've optimized for.

You said: I have some questions I'd like us
I have some questions I'd like us to answer before we get on with implementing this...

1. What are the heuristics we are expecting to see here?

I don't think the incoming data labels are going to be filling up the pool for long. Assuming our RML is expecting data in a particular format/schema, once we've seen a few documents we will have seen all the fixed data labels (be it column headings, xml/json element/attribute names, etc). It will be the rdf terms (literals and IRIs and predicates) that keep flooding in. Where are we likely to be generating these? In the workers, I would've thought, based on the Planner? We can see that is the case in the current implementation, where the workers get the largest pre-allocated arrays.

The worker, however, has no way to promote strings globally. The current heuristic is that planning strings are few and stored globally, common dependency paths and more frequent and appear in the groups, and both of these make sense. Now, workers will indeed see lots of new strings representing instance data, but also they will see the most generated rdf terms as well, and we are only caching these per worker...

Now, is the assumption here that the workers will get the same (approximate) paths every time, based on their membership in the groups? If this is the case then the heuristic stacks up well.
Copilot said: # RML String Pool Heuristics Analysis You've raised
RML String Pool Heuristics Analysis
You've raised an excellent question about the heuristics guiding our string pool design. Let me analyze the string usage patterns we're likely to see:

Expected String Usage Patterns
Planning/Template Strings

Loaded once at startup
Used by all workers
Stable throughout execution
Shared via global pool
JSON/XML Data Labels

Field names, element names, attribute names
You're absolutely right that these quickly stabilize
After processing a few documents, we'll have seen most schema elements
These benefit from group-level sharing
Generated RDF Terms

URIs constructed from templates + data values
Many follow predictable patterns (e.g., http://example.org/person/{id})
High volume, generated in workers
Currently no promotion path to share between workers
Instance Data Values

Actual content from documents (names, IDs, dates)
Mostly unique, high churn
Limited benefit from caching beyond local worker
Worker Locality and String Sharing
Your observation about workers getting similar paths based on group membership is correct. Looking at the dependency grouping in Planner.fs:

F#
let private groupByDependencies (plans: TriplesMapPlan[]) : DependencyGroups =
    // Groups maps with dependencies together
Maps in the same dependency group:

Process related parts of the document structure
Generate similar patterns of RDF terms
Operate on similar paths
Would benefit from sharing common strings
Current Limitations and Our Solution
The primary limitation in the current design is exactly what you identified: workers have no way to promote hot strings to higher tiers. This means:

If 10 workers all generate the same RDF predicate URI, it's stored 10 times
No mechanism to identify which strings would benefit from promotion
No way to share worker-discovered common patterns
Our chunked design with temperature tracking directly addresses this:

F#
// Periodically check chunk temperature
member this.PromoteHotChunks(targetPool: Pool) =
    for i = 0 to this.Chunks.Count - 1 do
        if this.ChunkTemperatures.[i] > this.PromotionThreshold then
            // Promote strings from this hot chunk
            for str in this.Chunks.[i] do
                if not (isNull str) then
                    targetPool.InternString(str) |> ignore
This gives us a mechanism to identify and promote frequently used strings from worker pools to group pools, creating a complete promotion path:

Code
Worker Pool (local) → Group Pool → Global Pool
This matches the expected usage patterns where common RDF terms should bubble up to appropriate sharing levels based on actual usage patterns rather than static allocation.
