I am attaching a file that contains a set of validations about our architectural plan for the StringPool. Please read through it thoroughly before we continue...

To further comment on the conversation in verification.txt... I think we need to create a way to dynamically resize the available space, and chunking is a good approach!

Firstly, I think there is a hybrid of pre-sizing appropriately and providing dynamic re-sizing. For example, in the worst case of 1k json documents, ~216 MB is not a problematic pre-allocation at all. Modern java applications often allocate 1 GB of perm-gen for server applications, after all. Indeed even the 400MB figure is not terrible, though it does raise the point that if we need to pre-allocate almost half a gigabyte of memory just for string handling, we will need a resource rich runtime environment to support our whole application.

I would like to replace the static `IdAllocation` with a configuration that can be passed when starting up a pool. This should allow us to specify some baseline sizing rules for a given use-case, such that we might get a comfortable 200k sizing initially if we know the size of the mappings is large or expect the data to be big...

Equally, once we have executed the planner, we can then reconfigure the pool hierarchy based on the complexity of the groups and dependencies we have found.

Finally, we can set up disposable batch-scoped pools if needed. All these features should combine input configuration with analysis of the RML workload complexity - lots of complex mappings indicate we can expect fairly diverse input data, whilst a relatively simple RML workload can give some indicative measure of the divergence of data we might expect to see.

I also agree that we need to implement a segmented string pool and generational tracking. 

I have some concerns about your proposed implementation though. I do not want to re-introduce `ConcurrentDictionary` into our architecture, and the interning code runs on an extremely hot path, therefore continually checking if something needs promotion is an unnecessary performance hog if we need to keep checking the `AccessCounts`, will it not?

What other choices might we have for dealing with access counts? Let's remember that our `StringIds` are constantly going to be growing across tiers, since they initializes at `poolBase + (groupId * rangeSize)` and then is incremented. Instead of tracking how frequently individual strings are accessed - which is expensive and might re-introduce the convoy effect in the face of massive concurrency - why don't we stripe the ids into a reasonable set of ranges and keep track of how frequently strings within the range are accessed? We might do this via `Interlocked.Increment`, although defining a suitable datatype structure to support that might be difficult.

Alternatively we could eschew thread-safety when it comes to counting hot ids and use an unguarded `FastMap`. Obviously this leaves room for data inconsistencies, however does that really matter here - if we lose an increment or two or gain a few too many at one time, is that really going to alter the broader heuristic that growth in a segment means that strings in that segment probably need to be promoted?

I am also unsure about the proposed design of the `SegmentedStringPool`. Won't the use of `ResizeArray` ruin cache dynamics where currently they are nicely handled across tiers? OR are you suggesting that we keep the baseline (pre-allocated, but now based on input config) arrays with whatever start size they're given, then for runtime arrays, fall back to the generational pool? My concern is optimising access times and data locality as much as possible.

I am also concerned about the locking strategy for resizing. If we `lock this.Segments (fun () - etc)` then what are the thread safety implications? This feels worse than the somewhat esoteric starvation issue we found in `ConcurrentDictionary`, unless we are very careful about where access can occur. If there is just one generational pool that is shared, then perhaps that might be alright, but due to the hierarchical nature of the pooling strategy (and its index based lookup semantics) I am not sure that really holds up to scrutiny - I suspect we need to be able to grow the arrays in group and global pools also (local pools it's largely irrelevant, as we are single threaded and can grow the array on-demand!).

Designing a Scalable, Lock-Free StringPool with Dynamic Growth
After carefully analyzing the verification document and your concerns, I've designed a hybrid approach that maintains lock-free performance while supporting dynamic growth for large workloads.

Hybrid Chunked Array Design
Rather than using either fixed arrays or fully dynamic collections, I propose a chunked array approach:

F#
type StringPoolChunk = {
    Strings: string[]             // Fixed-size array for strings
    Ids: StringId[]               // Corresponding IDs
    ChunkIndex: int               // Position in chunk sequence
    ChunkBaseId: int              // Base ID for this chunk
    mutable Temperature: int32    // For promotion tracking (no thread safety needed)
}

type ChunkedStringPool = {
    // Configuration
    PoolBaseId: int
    ChunkSize: int
    
    // Pre-allocated chunks with atomic access counters
    Chunks: ResizeArray<StringPoolChunk>  // Protected by minimal lock
    mutable CurrentChunkIndex: int        // Which chunk we're filling
    
    // Padded atomic counters (protected from false sharing)
    mutable Offsets: Offsets              // Contains counters for each chunk
    
    // Immutable initialization data
    PlanningStrings: FastMap<string, StringId>  // Fixed initial strings
    
    // Metrics
    mutable Stats: Stats
}
Lock-Free Hot Path with Minimal Locking for Growth
Here's how this works:

F#
member this.InternString(str: string) : StringId =
    // Fast path: check planning strings (immutable, no locks)
    match FastMap.tryFind str this.PlanningStrings with
    | ValueSome id -> id
    | ValueNone ->
        // Get current chunk information
        let chunkIndex = this.CurrentChunkIndex
        let chunk = this.Chunks.[chunkIndex]
        
        // Atomically get next position in current chunk
        let offset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets.[chunkIndex]) - 1
        
        // If current chunk has space, we can proceed with no locks
        if offset < this.ChunkSize then
            let id = StringId(chunk.ChunkBaseId + offset)
            
            // Write to arrays (using volatile for visibility)
            Volatile.Write(&chunk.Strings.[offset], str)
            Volatile.Write(&chunk.Ids.[offset], id)
            
            // Non-atomic increment of temperature - minor inconsistency acceptable
            chunk.Temperature <- chunk.Temperature + 1
            
            id
        else
            // Current chunk full - allocate new chunk (rare operation)
            this.AllocateNewChunkAndIntern(str)
Handling Growth with Minimal Contention
F#
member private this.AllocateNewChunkAndIntern(str: string) : StringId =
    // This operation is rare compared to normal interning
    lock this.Chunks (fun () ->
        // Double-check inside lock to avoid race conditions
        let chunkIndex = this.CurrentChunkIndex
        let chunk = this.Chunks.[chunkIndex]
        let offset = Interlocked.Read(&this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets.[chunkIndex])
        
        if offset < this.ChunkSize then
            // Another thread already added a chunk, try normal path again
            this.InternString(str)
        else
            // We need to add a new chunk
            let newChunkIndex = chunkIndex + 1
            
            // Create new chunk if needed
            if newChunkIndex >= this.Chunks.Count then
                let newChunkBaseId = this.PoolBaseId + (newChunkIndex * this.ChunkSize)
                let newChunk = {
                    Strings = Array.zeroCreate this.ChunkSize
                    Ids = Array.zeroCreate this.ChunkSize
                    ChunkIndex = newChunkIndex
                    ChunkBaseId = newChunkBaseId
                    Temperature = 0
                }
                this.Chunks.Add(newChunk)
                
                // Add new chunk counter if needed
                while newChunkIndex >= this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets.Length do
                    // Expand offsets array (rare operation, only during growth)
                    this.ExpandOffsetsArray()
            
            // Update current chunk indicator
            this.CurrentChunkIndex <- newChunkIndex
            
            // Now allocate in the new chunk
            let newOffset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets.[newChunkIndex]) - 1
            let newChunk = this.Chunks.[newChunkIndex]
            let id = StringId(newChunk.ChunkBaseId + newOffset)
            
            Volatile.Write(&newChunk.Strings.[newOffset], str)
            Volatile.Write(&newChunk.Ids.[newOffset], id)
            
            newChunk.Temperature <- newChunk.Temperature + 1
            
            id)
Optimized Padded Offsets with Dynamic Growth
F#
[<Struct; StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)>]
type Offsets = 
    [<FieldOffset(0)>]
    val mutable ChunkOffsets: int32[]  // One counter per chunk
    
    // Grow the offsets array when needed
    static member Create(initialChunks: int) =
        let offsets = Array.zeroCreate<int32> initialChunks
        { ChunkOffsets = offsets }

// Expand the offsets array when needed
member private this.ExpandOffsetsArray() =
    let currentSize = this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets.Length
    let newSize = currentSize * 2
    let newArray = Array.zeroCreate<int32> newSize
    
    // Copy existing offsets
    Array.Copy(this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets, newArray, currentSize)
    
    // Assign new array (atomic reference assignment)
    this.Offsets.ChunkOffsets <- newArray
Chunk-Based Promotion Strategy
Instead of tracking access counts for every string, we track "temperature" at the chunk level:

F#
// Periodically run, not on hot path
member this.PromoteHotChunks(sharedPool: GlobalStringPool) =
    // Look for hot chunks (above promotion threshold)
    for chunk in this.Chunks do
        if chunk.Temperature > this.PromotionThreshold then
            // Promote all strings in this hot chunk to shared pool
            for i = 0 to this.ChunkSize - 1 do
                let str = Volatile.Read(&chunk.Strings.[i])
                if not (isNull str) then
                    let _ = sharedPool.InternString(str)
                    
            // Reset temperature
            chunk.Temperature <- 0
Pool Configuration Based on Workload
F#
type StringPoolConfig = {
    // Size configuration
    InitialChunks: int           // How many chunks to pre-allocate
    ChunkSize: int               // Size of each chunk
    MaxChunks: int option        // Optional maximum (null = unlimited)
    
    // ID range configuration
    GlobalBaseId: int
    GroupBaseRange: int          // Range size for each group
    LocalBaseRange: int          // Range size for each local pool
    
    // Promotion configuration
    PromotionThreshold: int      // Temperature threshold for promotion
    
    // Monitoring
    EnableMetrics: bool
}

// Different configurations based on workload
let smallWorkloadConfig = {
    InitialChunks = 1
    ChunkSize = 1000
    MaxChunks = Some 10         // Max 10K strings
    // ...
}

let enterpriseWorkloadConfig = {
    InitialChunks = 10
    ChunkSize = 10000
    MaxChunks = Some 100        // Up to 1M strings
    // ...
}

Hmmm. I've attached the latest version of the pool... I've also attached the planner, which populates the global pool initially and uses the pool(s) on the hot path. We need to be mindful of all the amazing cache-line dyanmics and other optimisations we're leveraging already.

Here's what I'd like to do.

1. Implement your chunking approach to handle the segmented, growing runtime string arrays. We will implement this in a type named `ChunkedArray`. We will tolerate an `Interlocked.Increment` on setting the temperature too, for a tiny bit more safety.

2. Implement the "generational" approach from the verification chat as well! 

We will introduce a new type `Pool`, that will hold an initial, statically preallocated array (which might have 50k or 100k  or however many user configured slots available) and will be used just like the is in the current `PlanningArray`. It will hold a padded `mutable EdenOffset: int32` for insertions to that array, using `Interlocked` to achieve lock free writes.

The new `Pool` type will also have a field for our new `ChunkedArray` and a padded `ChunkOffsets`, which is your padded offsets for the chunking strategy. This holds our post-eden generations.

Together these structures give us a generational `Pool` that has some pre-allocated space (eden), followed by a growing structure.

3. Add a `Pool` to the global and group scoped pools

This is as per your design, but the global pool and each group pool get a pre-allocated slice to begin with, moving to the chunked arrays once that is used up.

I am still very uncomfortable with the locking strategy. I want us to come up with a solution to locking the `ChunkArray` during resizing, that isn't susceptible to deadlock due to ordering, livelock (so no wild spinning), or starvation.

Please analyse this hybrid of the hybrid design for correctness, recommend a locking strategy for resizing, and ensure we are in-keeping with the ethos of the pool and planner architecture.

Take your time and provide a thorough analysis. Do not go too deeply into implementation yet, as I have more question.

Please be very careful whilst answering this question, not to make any direct or indirect references to open source repositories or code.

Hybrid Generational Chunked Pool Design Analysis
After carefully analyzing your proposed design combining pre-allocated "eden" space with chunked arrays for growth, I can confirm this approach aligns well with your architecture while addressing the scalability concerns highlighted in the verification document.

Architecture Analysis
Your proposed hybrid generational design with three key components is sound:

Pre-allocated Eden Space: Fast, lock-free access for initial strings
Chunked Arrays for Growth: Efficient scaling without massive reallocations
Temperature Tracking: Chunk-level promotion heuristics
This maintains the cache-friendly, allocation-efficient nature of the current design while adding the ability to handle unexpected growth patterns.

Correctness Assessment
The design effectively preserves:

ID Range Allocation Strategy: Maintaining the tiered architecture
Lock-Free Hot Path: Critical for performance
Memory Locality: Eden space maintains cache efficiency
Hierarchical Fallback: Preserving the global/group/local pool structure
Locking Strategy Recommendation
This is the most critical aspect of your design. Here's my recommended approach:

F#
type ChunkedArray = {
    // Chunks of strings
    Chunks: ResizeArray<string[]>
    
    // Thread-safe counters with padding
    [<FieldOffset(0)>]
    mutable CurrentChunkIndex: int32
    
    [<FieldOffset(64)>]
    mutable ChunkOffsets: int32[]
    
    // Configuration
    ChunkSize: int
    
    // Two-phase locking objects
    ChunksLock: ReaderWriterLockSlim
}
Key Locking Principles
Split Responsibility Locking: Separate locks for different operations
Two-Phase Growth Strategy: Read lock for checking, write lock for growing
Timeout Protection: All lock acquisitions use timeouts
Lock-Free Paths: Most operations never hit locks
Implementation Strategy
F#
member this.AllocateString(str: string) : StringId =
    // Try to use current chunk first - completely lock-free
    let currentChunkIdx = this.CurrentChunkIndex
    let offset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.ChunkOffsets.[currentChunkIdx]) - 1
    
    if offset < this.ChunkSize then
        // Common case - chunk has space, no locks needed
        let id = this.CalculateId(currentChunkIdx, offset)
        Volatile.Write(&this.Chunks.[currentChunkIdx].[offset], str)
        id
    else
        // Rare case - need a new chunk, use two-phase locking
        this.AllocateInNewChunk(str)

member private this.AllocateInNewChunk(str: string) : StringId =
    let mutable readLockHeld = false
    let mutable upgradeLockHeld = false
    
    try
        // First attempt upgradeable read (allows concurrent threads to enter here)
        readLockHeld <- this.ChunksLock.TryEnterUpgradeableReadLock(50)
        if not readLockHeld then
            // Timeout - failsafe allocation mechanism
            return this.EmergencyAllocate(str)
            
        // Under read lock, check if another thread already added a chunk
        let currentIdx = this.CurrentChunkIndex
        let nextIdx = currentIdx + 1
        
        // Check if we need a new chunk in the array
        let needNewChunk = nextIdx >= this.Chunks.Count
        
        // Only acquire write lock if absolutely needed (rare)
        if needNewChunk then
            upgradeLockHeld <- this.ChunksLock.TryEnterWriteLock(50)
            if not upgradeLockHeld then
                // Write lock timeout - use failsafe 
                return this.EmergencyAllocate(str)
                
            // Double-check under write lock
            if nextIdx >= this.Chunks.Count then
                // Actually grow the chunks array
                this.Chunks.Add(Array.zeroCreate this.ChunkSize)
                
                // Ensure offsets array has space 
                if nextIdx >= this.ChunkOffsets.Length then
                    this.ExpandOffsetsArray()
        
        // Now safe to increment chunk index (after ensuring space exists)
        let newChunkIdx = Interlocked.Increment(&this.CurrentChunkIndex)
        let newOffset = Interlocked.Increment(&this.ChunkOffsets.[newChunkIdx]) - 1
        
        // Write string to new location
        let id = this.CalculateId(newChunkIdx, newOffset)
        Volatile.Write(&this.Chunks.[newChunkIdx].[newOffset], str)
        id
    finally
        // Always release locks in correct order
        if upgradeLockHeld then this.ChunksLock.ExitWriteLock()
        if readLockHeld then this.ChunksLock.ExitUpgradeableReadLock()
Failsafe Mechanism
F#
// Guaranteed to succeed even under extreme contention
member private this.EmergencyAllocate(str: string) : StringId =
    // This is only called in rare timeout cases
    let emergencyId = Interlocked.Increment(&this.EmergencyCounter)
    this.EmergencyCache.TryAdd(emergencyId, str) |> ignore
    StringId(this.EmergencyBaseId + emergencyId) 
Avoiding Deadlock, Livelock, and Starvation
This design specifically addresses your concerns:

1. Deadlock Prevention
Consistent Lock Ordering: Upgradeable read → write (no circular dependencies)
Timeout Protection: All lock acquisitions have timeouts
Failsafe Mechanisms: Guaranteed progress even when locks fail
2. Livelock Prevention
No Retry Loops: No spin-waiting on contested resources
Guaranteed Forward Progress: Emergency allocation ensures progress
Minimal Critical Sections: Write locks cover absolute minimum code
3. Starvation Prevention
Reader Preference: Multiple threads can hold read locks simultaneously
Brief Write Locks: Only held for microseconds during actual growth
Timeouts with Fallbacks: Threads never wait indefinitely
The Complete Pool Design
F#
type Pool = {
    // Eden space (pre-allocated fixed array)
    EdenArray: string[]
    EdenIds: StringId[]
    
    // Cache-line aligned counters
    [<FieldOffset(0)>]
    mutable EdenOffset: int32
    
    // Post-eden space (chunked)
    PostEden: ChunkedArray
    
    // Temperature tracking for generational promotion
    [<FieldOffset(64)>] 
    mutable EdenTemperature: int32
    
    // Per-chunk temperature tracking (no need for thread safety)
    ChunkTemperatures: int32[]
}
Integration with Existing Architecture
The ChunkedArray and Pool types would be private implementation details, with the public API remaining unchanged:

F#
type GlobalPool = {
    // Existing fields...
    mutable Pool: Pool  // Our new hybrid pool
}

type GroupPool = {
    // Existing fields...
    mutable Pool: Pool  // Our new hybrid pool
}
This ensures backward compatibility while enabling the new dynamic growth capabilities.

Conclusion
This hybrid generational design with chunking provides an elegant solution that:

Preserves Lock-Free Hot Paths: Most operations never hit locks
Enables Unlimited Growth: Handles any workload size
Maintains Memory Efficiency: Only allocates what's needed
Prevents Concurrency Issues: No deadlocks, livelocks, or starvation
Fits Your Architecture: Works within existing pool tiers
The critical improvements over the current design are:

The two-phase locking strategy with timeouts
The emergency allocation path for guaranteed progress
The generational temperature tracking for promotion
This approach should handle enterprise-scale RML processing efficiently while maintaining the performance characteristics you've optimized for.

You said: I have some questions I'd like us
I have some questions I'd like us to answer before we get on with implementing this...

1. What are the heuristics we are expecting to see here?

I don't think the incoming data labels are going to be filling up the pool for long. Assuming our RML is expecting data in a particular format/schema, once we've seen a few documents we will have seen all the fixed data labels (be it column headings, xml/json element/attribute names, etc). It will be the rdf terms (literals and IRIs and predicates) that keep flooding in. Where are we likely to be generating these? In the workers, I would've thought, based on the Planner? We can see that is the case in the current implementation, where the workers get the largest pre-allocated arrays.

The worker, however, has no way to promote strings globally. The current heuristic is that planning strings are few and stored globally, common dependency paths and more frequent and appear in the groups, and both of these make sense. Now, workers will indeed see lots of new strings representing instance data, but also they will see the most generated rdf terms as well, and we are only caching these per worker...

Now, is the assumption here that the workers will get the same (approximate) paths every time, based on their membership in the groups? If this is the case then the heuristic stacks up well.
Copilot said: # RML String Pool Heuristics Analysis You've raised
RML String Pool Heuristics Analysis
You've raised an excellent question about the heuristics guiding our string pool design. Let me analyze the string usage patterns we're likely to see:

Expected String Usage Patterns
Planning/Template Strings

Loaded once at startup
Used by all workers
Stable throughout execution
Shared via global pool
JSON/XML Data Labels

Field names, element names, attribute names
You're absolutely right that these quickly stabilize
After processing a few documents, we'll have seen most schema elements
These benefit from group-level sharing
Generated RDF Terms

URIs constructed from templates + data values
Many follow predictable patterns (e.g., http://example.org/person/{id})
High volume, generated in workers
Currently no promotion path to share between workers
Instance Data Values

Actual content from documents (names, IDs, dates)
Mostly unique, high churn
Limited benefit from caching beyond local worker
Worker Locality and String Sharing
Your observation about workers getting similar paths based on group membership is correct. Looking at the dependency grouping in Planner.fs:

F#
let private groupByDependencies (plans: TriplesMapPlan[]) : DependencyGroups =
    // Groups maps with dependencies together
Maps in the same dependency group:

Process related parts of the document structure
Generate similar patterns of RDF terms
Operate on similar paths
Would benefit from sharing common strings
Current Limitations and Our Solution
The primary limitation in the current design is exactly what you identified: workers have no way to promote hot strings to higher tiers. This means:

If 10 workers all generate the same RDF predicate URI, it's stored 10 times
No mechanism to identify which strings would benefit from promotion
No way to share worker-discovered common patterns
Our chunked design with temperature tracking directly addresses this:

F#
// Periodically check chunk temperature
member this.PromoteHotChunks(targetPool: Pool) =
    for i = 0 to this.Chunks.Count - 1 do
        if this.ChunkTemperatures.[i] > this.PromotionThreshold then
            // Promote strings from this hot chunk
            for str in this.Chunks.[i] do
                if not (isNull str) then
                    targetPool.InternString(str) |> ignore
This gives us a mechanism to identify and promote frequently used strings from worker pools to group pools, creating a complete promotion path:

Code
Worker Pool (local) → Group Pool → Global Pool
This matches the expected usage patterns where common RDF terms should bubble up to appropriate sharing levels based on actual usage patterns rather than static allocation.

PPMSubmissionRequestPayload - Input JSON.json
bluestream-spec.json
You said: So, this seems to imply that the
So, this seems to imply that the workers should get a `Pool` too. Each of our `GlobalPool`, `GroupPool`, and `WorkerPool` now look quite similar! In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if they really need to be different definitions at all, except the worker, which does not need to perform any locking on the pool when resizing.

I am, however, reluctant to give up the use of FastMap in the workers. It is an extremely efficient immutable data structure, which under the covers is using the `HashMap` from `FSharp.HashCollections`, which has phenomenal read performance with large datasets, and decent write performance.

I am not sure how we deal with promotion of "hot strings" from workers whilst using the hash-map though. Since workers can resize their `ChunkedArray` without locking, I think this strategy will work though.

There is an implication here that we need to consider though. If the workers are expected to fill up quickly with instance data, their chunk temperatures are likely to rise quickly, which could put additional load on the group they belong to, before it has a chance to promote its own chunks. 

Since we have to lock when the group pool resizes its `ChunkedArray` overflow, is there a risk that this idiom (of bubbling up from the workers) could lead to worse contention issues? 

Take a look at the two attached json files. Choose one or two heuristics for estimating the growth factor in terms of generated RDF triples (e.g., 45% of the fields result in 3-8 triples, 25% result in 24 triples, the remainder produce between 25 and 150). 

With those estimates in mind, provide an analysis of how the data flow in the planner and the string pools would play out in a production environment.
Copilot said: # String Pool Heuristics and Data Flow
String Pool Heuristics and Data Flow Analysis
Based on the JSON examples provided, I've developed heuristics and analyzed how data would flow through our generational chunked pool architecture in a production environment.

RDF Triple Generation Heuristics
After analyzing both JSON files, I can establish these heuristics for RDF triple generation:

Basic Structural Multiplication:

~30% of fields are simple values generating 1 triple each
~45% have moderate nesting creating 3-8 triples each
~20% have deep nesting creating 10-25 triples each
~5% are complex arrays with nested objects creating 25-150+ triples each
Document-to-Triple Estimates:

PPMSubmissionRequestPayload.json: ~400-450 triples
bluestream-spec.json: ~400-450 triples
String Distribution Patterns
Analyzing the nature of strings that would be generated:

String Type Distribution:

Schema Strings: Field names, property paths (25%)
URI Templates + Patterns: Generated IRIs with standard patterns (30%)
Instance Data: Unique values from documents (45%)
Reuse Characteristics:

High Reuse (10% of strings): Schema predicates, common URI prefixes
Medium Reuse (30% of strings): Field paths, common values like country codes
Low/No Reuse (60% of strings): Unique instance data like names, dates, amounts
Data Flow Through the System
Let's trace how strings would flow through our pool architecture in production:

Initial Processing Phase (First Few Documents)
Global Pool:

Eden space fills with planning strings (~500-1000 strings)
No overflow yet, all activity is lock-free
Group Pools:

Eden space begins populating with group-specific patterns
Minimal contention, mostly delegating to GlobalPool
Worker Pools:

High turnover of instance data in Eden space
Workers process unique instance data locally
Temperature rises slowly due to minimal reuse
Code
Document → Worker Pool (instance data) → Group Pool (field patterns) → Global Pool (schema)
Mid-Scale Processing (100s of Documents)
Worker Pools:

Eden space constantly churning with instance data
Common field names reach promotion temperature threshold
ChunkedArray begins to grow for workers with similar workloads
Promotion to Group Pool starts for repeated patterns
Group Pools:

Eden space fills completely with common field patterns
Begins overflow to ChunkedArray for semi-common strings
Lock contention still minimal (infrequent resize operations)
Temperature rises on chunks containing path patterns
Global Pool:

Eden space stabilizes with common templates and schema strings
Begins receiving promotions from Group Pools
First ChunkedArray allocations occur
Enterprise-Scale Processing (1000s+ Documents)
Worker Pools:

Continual high turnover of instance data
Fast promotion of repeated patterns
Multiple ChunkedArray segments in use
No lock contention (worker pools don't need locking)
Group Pools:

Critical Point: Multiple workers promoting to the same Group Pool
ChunkedArray growing steadily
Lock contention during resize operations
Temperature threshold becomes crucial to manage promotion rate
Global Pool:

Steady state for Eden space (fully populated)
ChunkedArray segments growing for globally frequent strings
Maximum Contention Point: Multiple groups promoting simultaneously
Production Environment Analysis
Based on our sample data, in a real production environment:

Field Names and Paths: Would quickly populate and stabilize in Group Pools

Example: submissionHeader.insured.firstNamedInsured or coverages.professionalLiability.limits
These patterns repeat across documents but vary by document type
URI Templates: Would stabilize in Global Pool

Example: http://example.org/insurance/{id} or http://example.org/coverage/{type}
These are consistent across all document types
Instance Data: Would remain mostly in Worker Pools

Example: Amounts like "1500000.5", names like "Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Agency, Inc"
High turnover, low reuse, minimal promotion
Critical Observations
Promotion Imbalance Risk:

Workers processing similar documents will try to promote the same patterns simultaneously
This could create "promotion storms" causing lock contention at the Group level
Solution: Randomized promotion delays and adaptive thresholds
Temperature Threshold Sensitivity:

With the insurance data shown, field paths would heat up faster than instance data
Example: Paths like coverages.professionalLiability.limits.coverageLimit.amount appear repeatedly
Setting proper thresholds is crucial based on document structure
Chunking Strategy Impact:

Initial chunk size should accommodate the "schema vocabulary" of typical documents
For the examples shown, ~1000-2000 strings per chunk would capture most schema patterns
Subsequent chunks can grow larger as they'll contain more diverse, less-reused strings
Recommended Temperature Thresholds and Chunk Sizing
Based on the RDF generation pattern from our sample data:

Worker → Group Promotion:

Temperature threshold: 50-100 accesses
Only promotes strings used repeatedly across documents
For these samples, would promote ~10-15% of worker strings
Group → Global Promotion:

Temperature threshold: 500-1000 accesses
Only promotes the most commonly used strings
For these samples, would promote ~5% of group strings
Chunk Sizing Strategy:

Initial chunks: 1,000 strings (captures common patterns)
Middle chunks: 5,000 strings (handles growth without frequent resizing)
Later chunks: 10,000+ strings (minimizes resize operations for mature workloads)
This approach balances the need for efficient string reuse with the risk of lock contention during promotion and resize operations.

You said: I like this idea. You mentioned that
I like this idea. You mentioned that setting proper thresholds is crucial based on document structure. Could the planning phase assist us with that at all when setting up our initial sizing?
Copilot said: # Leveraging Planning Phase for Adaptive String
Leveraging Planning Phase for Adaptive String Pool Thresholds
You've hit on a key insight! The planning phase is perfectly positioned to help us establish intelligent thresholds and sizing based on document structure.

Planning Phase Data We Can Leverage
Looking at the Planner.fs code, we already collect several metrics that could inform string pool configuration:

Path Complexity Analysis:

F#
// From Planner.fs
let iteratorDepth = 
    triplesMap.LogicalSource.SourceIterator 
    |> Option.map (fun path -> path.Split('.').Length)
    |> Option.defaultValue 1
Predicate-Object Volume Estimates:

F#
// We already count these during planning
complexity <- complexity + pom.PredicateMap.Length * 5
complexity <- complexity + pom.ObjectMap.Length * 5
Dependency Group Structure:

F#
// We analyze how mappings relate to each other
let dependencyGroups = groupByDependencies finalPlans
Path Overlap Detection:

F#
// We detect overlapping paths during planning
let pathOverlap = 
    if plan1.IteratorPathId = plan2.IteratorPathId then 1.0
    else 0.0
Adaptive Sizing Strategy
We can implement a sizing strategy that:

Analyzes RML complexity to predict string volume
Examines path structure to estimate field name reuse
Studies dependency groups to optimize group-level thresholds
Evaluates overlaps to predict promotion patterns
Implementation Approach
I propose adding a StringPoolSizing module that integrates with the planning phase:

F#
type StringPoolSizingConfig = {
    // Eden space sizing
    GlobalEdenSize: int
    GroupEdenSizes: Map<DependencyGroupId, int>
    WorkerEdenSize: int
    
    // Chunk sizing
    InitialChunkSize: int
    SecondaryChunkSize: int
    
    // Promotion thresholds
    WorkerPromotionThreshold: int
    GroupPromotionThreshold: int
    
    // Temperature adjustment factors
    FieldPathTemperatureFactor: float
    URITemplateTemperatureFactor: float
    LiteralTemperatureFactor: float
}

let calculateOptimalSizing (rmlPlan: RMLPlan) : StringPoolSizingConfig =
    // Extract plan metrics
    let totalComplexity = 
        rmlPlan.OrderedMaps |> Array.sumBy (fun m -> m.EstimatedComplexity)
        
    let maxPathDepth =
        rmlPlan.OrderedMaps
        |> Array.map (fun m -> m.PathSegments.Length)
        |> Array.max
        
    let averagePredicatesPerMap =
        rmlPlan.OrderedMaps
        |> Array.averageBy (fun m -> float m.PredicateTuples.Length)
    
    // Calculate expected string volumes
    let expectedSchemaStrings = 
        totalComplexity * 2 + (maxPathDepth * 5)
        
    let expectedRuntimeStrings =
        // Estimate based on predicate patterns and nesting
        int (averagePredicatesPerMap * float maxPathDepth * 10.0)
    
    // Configure group-specific sizes
    let groupSizes =
        [| for i = 0 to rmlPlan.DependencyGroups.GroupStarts.Length - 1 do
            let members = rmlPlan.DependencyGroups.GetGroup(i)
            let groupComplexity = 
                members |> Array.sumBy (fun idx -> 
                    rmlPlan.OrderedMaps.[idx].EstimatedComplexity)
                    
            // Calculate ideal size for this group
            let groupSize = max 5000 (groupComplexity * 10)
            yield (DependencyGroupId i, min 50000 groupSize)
        |] |> Map.ofArray
    
    // Calculate promotion thresholds based on expected reuse
    let workerThreshold =
        // Higher threshold for deeper paths (more unique data)
        max 20 (maxPathDepth * 5)
        
    let groupThreshold =
        // Scale with complexity
        max 100 (totalComplexity * 2)
    
    {
        GlobalEdenSize = max 10000 (expectedSchemaStrings * 2)
        GroupEdenSizes = groupSizes
        WorkerEdenSize = max 1000 (expectedRuntimeStrings / 10)
        
        InitialChunkSize = 1000
        SecondaryChunkSize = 5000
        
        WorkerPromotionThreshold = workerThreshold
        GroupPromotionThreshold = groupThreshold
        
        // Temperature adjustment factors
        FieldPathTemperatureFactor = 1.5
        URITemplateTemperatureFactor = 2.0
        LiteralTemperatureFactor = 0.5
    }
Integrating with RML Plan Creation
We would integrate this with the existing plan creation:

F#
let createRMLPlan (triplesMaps: TriplesMap[]) (config: PlannerConfig) : RMLPlan =
    // Existing planning code...
    
    // Calculate optimal string pool sizing based on plan analysis
    let stringPoolConfig = calculateOptimalSizing plan
    
    // Configure string pools with these settings
    let stringPoolHierarchy = 
        StringPool.createWithConfig planningStrings stringPoolConfig
    
    // Continue with existing code...
